    <!--Learned how to style tables in css from this video: https://youtu.be/dK27jWKtJxs 
        in this page, the header and footer style and code are kept the same as the other pages for consistency
        the rest of the page is composed of a table using html
        the table is broken into 4 columns: lab #, dates, descriptions, and links to the labs
        using tr, the rows were created in the table, th is used for the topmost row as headers,
        the rest of the rows are filled in with data with td
        links are added into the last column using a href
        multiple rows were created in advance for future labs -->

                    In our first lab, our assignment is to create to this entire website and its first four webpages. We can only use HTML and CSS.
                    The webpages we have to build are a home page, labs page, a page for personal information, and a resume page. The home page has to have a header,
                    footer, and a navigation bar. The labs page needs to have a layout for us to link our labs throughout the semester. We also have to create a folder
                    for the images that we use.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I have used some HTML and CSS in the past, but this assignment is the most I've used both of them.
                    I have never used Javascript before, but I have seen code of it and watched some videos that used it.
                    Some of the techniques I employed in this lab include using floats to style the home page, adding multiple links
                    throughout the project, adding several images to a couple pages, and creating a table in HTML and styling it with CSS
                    in the labs page. I've never styled a table with CSS before, so I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/dK27jWKtJxs">video</a> to learn how.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    When I first started this assignment, I could not figure out how to format the layouts of the pages. I watched a few videos and still had trouble understading.
                    I thought the lab was tedious then, but Professor Pascucci realized that he didn't finish teaching us CSS layout and finished the lecutre.
                    His examples during class made the process much easier to understand and I managed to finsih the lab within a few hours after.
